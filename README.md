# Explore-Weather-Trend
This was the first early hands on project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree (DAND) program: Term 1.

In this project, we needed to examine local and global temperature data to get insight some meaningful information. We needed to then think about the temperature patterns where we lived to that of generally global temperature trends. A representation and review depicting the similarities and differences were to go with the code.
